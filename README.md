# ux-tips
A collection of low effort ux improvements

## Essentials
- [ ] Title - page title and sitename never fails. 
- [ ] Favicon - there should always be one. Make yours unique.

## Animation
- [ ] Reduce motion. Style animations and transitions with the reduce motion media query. You can also enable reduce motion with a click of a button e.g. https://wethecollective.com

## Misc
- [ ] Link - style content visited links. Don't present visited link the same way as normal (unvisited) links. Let the user know that he/she already clicked that link or visited that page.
 
- [ ] Text - Style selected text (to match with the design).
